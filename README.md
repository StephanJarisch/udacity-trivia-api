## trivia - App

The task of this project was to finish the backend. The frontend was provided by Udacity.

Now on this website you can:
- Add questions
- Remove questions
- Sort questions by topic and
- take a quiz

1. Use Flask-CORS to enable cross-domain requests and set response headers.
2. Create an endpoint to handle GET requests for questions, including pagination (every 10 questions). This endpoint should return a list of questions, number of total questions, current category, categories.
3. Create an endpoint to handle GET requests for all available categories.
4. Create an endpoint to DELETE question using a question ID.
5. Create an endpoint to POST a new question, which will require the question and answer text, category, and difficulty score.
6. Create a POST endpoint to get questions based on category.
7. Create a POST endpoint to get questions based on a search term. It should return any questions for whom the search term is a substring of the question.
8. Create a POST endpoint to get questions to play the quiz. This endpoint should take category and previous question parameters and return a random questions within the given category, if provided, and that is not one of the previous questions.
9. Create error handlers for all expected errors including 400, 404, 422 and 500.
